            <li><span>Advanced markets allow investors to earn when asset prices go up or down, depending on the type of operation they take. In general, the two main types of operations are buy and sell.</span></li>
            <li><span>In Buy operations, investor win when market go up and lose when market go down.</span></li>
            <li><span>In Sell operations, investor win when market go down and lose when market go up.</span></li>
            <li><span>For this application, we can choose the type of operation but we do not know what will happen to the market in short term, so the result of taking the operation is random. This assumption is the best alternative to learn about risk control, because is the worst scenario to the investor and we are forced to handle uncertainty.</span></li>
